I made this project for my Advance Java class (CIT-285) at BHCC. I have since lost the original assignment sheet. At the time I worked on the project I had no need for git or github and therefore never created a repo for it. I am now uploading it to github for my resume incase potential employers would like to view it.
For this project we were assigned the task of creating a slot machine using a Java UI framework. I chose to use JavaFX because at the time it was still included in the JDK we were using for the class (jdk 7 iirc), and for it's ease of use. We also had the option to use Swing or AWT but I used those in other projects.
I learned a lot about threading from this project as we had to use threading in order to simulate the spinning for each reel. I also learned how to use the JavaFX media library to add sounds and sound effects to a project. This project also includes a bit of CSS for an overall great appearance.
